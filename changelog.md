## 3.0

### Deprecated

- Removed the "Most-recent update" and "Count" columns in `feeds.csv` in order to simplify diffs and reflect the fact the feeds update more recently than this repo.

## 2.01

2022-12-31

### Fixed

- `subscriptions.opml` was valid XML and OPML, but contained no `<outline type="rss" />` elements, and so it was not interpreted as containing feeds by some feed readers. This has been fixed.

### Added

- `subscriptions.opml.php` generates a valid OPML file, whose contents are now saved as `subscriptions.opml`
- `README.md` now contains a description of how to update this repository, including instructions on how to use `subscriptions.opml.php`

### Added

- Added a title to the OPML file
- Added other metadata to the OPML file

## 1.1

2022-12-22
